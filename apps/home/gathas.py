    ## Using the Telephone

    Words can travel thousands of miles.

    May my words create mutual understanding and love.

    May they be as beautiful as gems,

    As lovely as cut flowers.

    Turning on the computer,

    My mind gets in touch with the store.

    I vow to transform habit energies,

    To help love and understanding grow.

    ## Waking Up

    Waking up this morning, I smile.

    Twenty four brand new hours are before me.

    I vow to live life fully in each moment,

    And to look at all beings with eyes of compassion.
