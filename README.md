# min-home

## Summary

Minhome is a custom home page that allows a user to store favorites in the cloud and access them on a custom home page. It also provides several other pages with additional functionality: a "tasks" page, a contact manager, and a notes page.

A user can also link a Google account, so that contacts added to the contact manager are synced to their Google account. 

The user can designate task lists to display on their home page during the first time it is accessed in the morning. If a Google account is linked, they can also have their upcoming Google calendar events shown there in the same fashion, as well.

There is also a weather page that pulls data through the Open Weather API, along with some pages that can pull and display securities and crypto data.

The favorites, contacts, and notes are all searchable with a single, consolidated search function.

## Installation

Minhome is based on Django and can be installed and configured like any other Django application using any datase backend. Simply pull the repository, install dependences, and run the migrations.
